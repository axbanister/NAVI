# Project NAVI
The Level 1 helpdesk companion

Current versions in this repository are dependant upon the scripts lining up perfectly with your file structure, which it won't. Once ready for implementation, this code will be altered such that whenever it needs to refer to a specific file path, it will point to a domain file share that won't change.

Note to contributors: Please do not overwrite any files in this repository with versions tailored specifically to your system. Feel free to download the available releases to play around with, and then save them as new versions with your name in the filename.

Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/axbanister/NAVI/wiki) for usage information.
